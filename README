# Honest NFT

**Honest NFT** is an Ethereum-based project that combines an **ERC721 smart contract** with a **React front end** to create a decentralized application (DApp) for minting and trading Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Let's break down the components:

1. **Smart Contract (Solidity)**
   - The **ERC721** standard ensures that each NFT is unique and indivisible.
   - Trust is established through code, making it transparent and tamper-proof.
   - Users can mint new NFTs, and the contract enforces their authenticity.

2. **Front End (React)**
   - The front end provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Honest NFT.
   - Key features include:
     - **Minting NFTs**: Users can create their own NFTs.
     - **Backoffice UI**: An administrative interface for managing the NFT drop.
     - **Marketplace**: Users can trade NFTs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/honest-nft.git
   cd honest-nft
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies for the Front End:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**
   - Use **Hardhat** to manage the project.
   - Update the `hardhat.config.js` file with your network configuration.
   - Compile and deploy the smart contract:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
     ```

## Usage

- Visit the front end in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`) and connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- Mint new NFTs or explore the marketplace.
